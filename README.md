> Triangular graphs are graphs with three axis instead of two, taking the form of an equilateral triangle. The important features are that each axis is divided into 100, representing percentage. From each axis lines are drawn at an angle of 60 degrees to carry the values across the graph. The data used must be in the form of three components.
